# BlackjackProject

### Description

BlackJack Project is a simulation for the blackJack game in the real world.
This game starts with a welcome message followed by the simple question "Deal? (y/n)".
The player/user's respond to this question by typing a simple answer lowercase y or n determines either the start of the game or the continuation of the game after each round of hands.
The round of hands is a series of deals/plays until there are enough cards left on the deck to play one more hand which is usually 10 cards.
