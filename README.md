### Description

BlackJack Project is a simulation for the blackJack game in the real world.
This game starts with a welcome message followed by the simple question "Deal? (y/n)".
The player/user's respond to this question by typing a simple answer lowercase y or n determines either to start the program or to continue the program after each round of hands.
The round of hands is a series of deals/plays until there are enough cards left on the deck to play one more hand which is usually 10 cards.
Each player (in this case the one player and the dealer) are give two cards at the beginning to start with. The first dealer's card is hidden but the rest of the four cards are displayed. If the player's hand value (the total value of the cards in player's hand) is 21 at the beginning, then there is a possibility of push in case of dealer's hand value is also 21.
If the dealer's hand value is 21 at the beginning then the dealer is announced winner and the game ends.
If the user's hand value is less than 21 the user has an option to choose h for Hit or s for Stand. If user chooses hit then he/she will be given a new card which is displayed on the table.
At this time if the player's hand is larger than 21, the player is busted and the dealer is announced as winner but if the player's hand is 21 then the game continues in case of push
If the player decides to stand then a new card will be given to dealer and the same rules are applied to the dealer's hand to determine if the dear is busted or the wins.
There are a set of rules which applies to the dealer specifically and not to the player. The Dealer's decisions are based on game logic in the program.
The Dealer must decide to Hit or Stay based on the rules of Blackjack: if the Dealer's hand total is below 17, the Dealer must Hit; if the hand total is 17 or above, the Dealer must Stay.
